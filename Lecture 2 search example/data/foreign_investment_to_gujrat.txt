To attract foreign investment to Gujarat when he was chief minister, Modi visited China, Singapore and Japan,[159] travelling to China in November 2006 (to study the country's special economic zones, about to be implemented in Gujarat),[160] September 2007[161] and November 2011. A month after his 2011 visit, the Chinese government released 13 Indian diamond traders charged with smuggling in Shenzhen, with Modi attributing their release to his diplomacy and statesmanship.[162][163]

His relationship with many Western nations was troubled during his tenure as chief minister, with questions about his role in the 2002 riots resulting in travel bans to the UK, the US and the EU. Modi was barred from entering the United States under a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act banning violators of religious freedom,[164] the only person denied a US visa under this provision.[165] The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[166] and the EU[167] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.[168][169]

Regarding the United States of America (U.S.), on 16 March 2005, Rep. Conyers and Rep. Pitts in the U.S. House of Representatives in Congress, submitted H.RES.160, banning Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister of the State of Gujarat in India from entering the U.S. indefinitely. The title of the document is: "Condemning the conduct of Chief Minister Narendra Modi for his actions to incite religious persecution and urging the United States to condemn all violations of religious freedom in India."
