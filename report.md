(Part A)
The search algorithms used for evaluation were google, bing, duckduckgo and yahoo. Google
was used as a baseline for comparison. The search algorithms were evaluated based on the
query 'information retrieval evaluation'. We retrieved 7 documents from google, 4 from bing,
20 from duckduckgo and 6 from yahoo. 

(Part B)

A brief report comparing the evaluation of the three search algorithms. For each metric briefly describe the metric, the scores/plots obtained on the tree search techniques and a comparative evaluation of these scores

Google was used as a baseline for comparison. 
According to the results we can see that the other 3 search engines where not as precise as the baseline.
The results for the precision are as follow:
Baseline Google:    1.0
Bing:               0.4
Duckduckgo:         0.2
Yahoo:              0.6

The results for the recall are as follow:
Baseline Google:    1.0
Bing:               0.5714285714285714
Duckduckgo:         0.5714285714285714
Yahoo:              0.42857142857142855
