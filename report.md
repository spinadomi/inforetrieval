(Part A)
The search algorithms used for evaluation were google, bing, duckduckgo and yahoo. Google
was used as a baseline for comparison. The search algorithms were evaluated based on the
query 'information retrieval evaluation'. We retrieved 7 documents from google, 4 from bing,
20 from duckduckgo and 6 from yahoo. 

(Part B)

A brief report comparing the evaluation of the three search algorithms. For each metric briefly describe the metric, the scores/plots obtained on the tree search techniques and a comparative evaluation of these scores
